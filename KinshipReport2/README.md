Kinship Report

Based on the [built-in Kinship report](https://www.gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Gramps_6.0_Wiki_Manual_-_Reports_-_part_6#Kinship_Report).

19 Apr 2024, a user on Discourse asked about [Adding data in kinship report](https://gramps.discourse.group/t/adding-data-in-kinship-report/5287). 

In particular, they wanted inclusion of the GrampsID to be a a configuration option. That was easily added and [PR 1709](https://github.com/gramps-project/gramps/pull/1709) was proposed for the 5.2 maintenance branch. Re-based for 6.0 and released.
